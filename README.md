## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

A `.env.example` file is provided in the repository as a template. Copy this file to create your own `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

```
# Appwrite Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PLATFORM=com.user.extension
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID=your_user_collection_id

# API Base
# Preferred: set AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3 to your Fly.io URL
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://your-app.fly.dev
# Alternatively, you can set EXPO_PUBLIC_AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3 or EXPO_PUBLIC_FLY_API_URL or EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL

# Application Environment
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
```

> **Important:** Replace all placeholder values with your actual API keys and configuration values.

### Appwrite Setup

To properly configure Appwrite for this application:

1. **Create an Appwrite Project**:
   - Go to your [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Copy the Project ID from Project Settings > General

2. **Register the Android Platform**:
   - Go to Project Settings > Platforms
   - Click "Add Platform" > Select "Android"
   - Enter the package name: `com.user.extension`
   - Save the platform

3. **Create Database and Collections**:
   - Create a new database or use an existing one
   - Note the Database ID
   - Create a user collection or use an existing one
   - Note the Collection ID
   - Set up the appropriate attributes and indexes for each collection

4. **Update Your .env File**:
   - Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` to your actual Project ID
   - Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` to your Database ID
   - Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID` to your User Collection ID

For more detailed information about the Appwrite setup, refer to the [API Documentation](API.md).

## Server API (cards/payments)

Use a Fly.io-hosted mock server that handles card storage and payment flows.

### Dummy Mode & Seeding
- Set DUMMY_MODE=true on the server to enable safe demo behavior.
- Card creation rules:
  - Luhn-valid card numbers are required
  - In dummy mode, numbers with repeated 4-digit chunks are rejected (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Server generates a random token; the app stores this token on the card and uses it as the payment source.
- Fingerprint is randomized in dummy mode (not derived from the PAN).
- Seeding: POST /v1/dev/seed-transactions to generate demo payments and adjust balances.

- Configure the app to use it by setting in your .env:
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.fly.dev
    or
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_FLY_API_URL=https://your-app.fly.dev

CORS
- Browsers must match exact origins. Examples:
  - Dev: http://localhost:19006,http://localhost:8081
  - Snack (optional): https://snack.expo.dev
  - Prod: https://app.yourdomain.com
- React Native (device/emulator) generally has no Origin header; CORS is primarily for web/Snack.

401/CORS troubleshooting
- 401: Verify your client obtains an Appwrite JWT (account.createJWT()) and includes Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
- CORS error: Ensure the browser origin is listed in CORS_ORIGINS exactly (scheme, no trailing slash)

- What it provides:
  - POST /v1/cards (adds a card; requires Authorization: Bearer <Appwrite JWT>)
  - GET /v1/cards
  - DELETE /v1/cards/:id
  - Payments endpoints (authorize, capture, refund) and Notifications endpoints

Note: The local server directory (server/) is deprecated and kept only for reference. Do not run it locally.

### Optimization Tips
- Use Idempotency-Key on POST requests to avoid duplicates when retrying.
- Keep Expo packages on expected patch versions (Expo CLI suggests versions at startup).
- In server Dockerfile, pin Bun version and prefer `bun install --ci` for reproducible builds.
- Use tunnel mode for easy device testing: bunx expo start --tunnel.

### Verifying Environment Variables

You can verify that your environment variables are set up correctly by running:

```bash
npm run test-env
# or
yarn test-env
```

This will display all the configured environment variables and help you identify any issues with your setup.

### Testing Appwrite Connection

To verify that your Appwrite configuration is correct and that you can connect to Appwrite:

```bash
npm run test-appwrite
# or
yarn test-appwrite
```

This test script will:
- Check your Appwrite configuration
- Attempt to connect to Appwrite
- Provide specific troubleshooting tips if there are any issues

If you see the "Project with the requested ID could not be found" or "Invalid Origin" errors, this test will help you diagnose and fix the problems.


## 💡 Usage Examples

### Authentication

The application provides a secure authentication system with email/password login:

1. **Sign Up**:
   - Navigate to the Sign Up screen
   - Enter your name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password
   - The system validates your input (email format, password strength)
   - Upon successful registration, you'll be redirected to the onboarding screen

2. **Sign In**:
   - Navigate to the Sign In screen
   - Enter your email and password
   - Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the home screen

### Adding a Card

1. Navigate to the Cards screen
2. Tap on "+ Add Card"
3. Enter your card details
4. The app will call your server at /v1/cards using your Appwrite JWT (Bearer token)
5. On success, a masked card (•••• •••• •••• last4) will be added to your list

### Using the Alert System

The application includes a comprehensive alert system for user feedback:

```javascript
// Import the useAlert hook
import { useAlert } from '@/context/AlertContext';

// Inside your component
const { showAlert } = useAlert();

// Show a success alert
showAlert('success', 'Your payment was processed successfully.', 'Payment Successful');

// Show an error alert
showAlert('error', 'Payment failed. Please try again.', 'Payment Error');

// Show a warning alert
showAlert('warning', 'Your account balance is low.', 'Low Balance');

// Show an info alert
showAlert('info', 'New features are available.', 'Information');
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

1. Update the environment variables for production:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npx expo build:android  # For Android
   # or
   npx expo build:ios      # For iOS
   ```

3. Follow the Expo build instructions to complete the process

### Publishing to App Stores

## 🔮 Roadmap

Future plans for the BankApp include:

- **Biometric Authentication**: Add fingerprint and face recognition for secure login
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark theme option for better user experience
- **Push Notifications**: Add real-time notifications for transactions and account updates
- **Expense Analytics**: Add charts and graphs for visualizing spending patterns
- **Multiple Languages**: Add support for multiple languages
- **Offline Mode**: Implement offline functionality for basic features

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All sensitive information is stored in environment variables, not hardcoded in the source code
- Authentication is handled securely through Appwrite's authentication system
- Passwords are validated for strength during registration
- Payment processing is handled by the server API; PAN/CVC never touch the app and only masked/metadata are stored
- Session management includes proper timeout and cleanup
