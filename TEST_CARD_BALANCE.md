# Card Balance Functionality Test

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Card Type Import Issues
- Fixed Card type imports in cardService.ts and useAppwriteCards.ts
- Ensured proper type definitions are used consistently

### 2. Fixed findCardByNumber Function
- Updated function signature to accept optional holderName parameter for backward compatibility
- Added proper parameter handling and search logic

### 3. Fixed Card Creation Data Structure
- Added missing `isActive` property to card creation data
- Ensured all required Card interface fields are properly included

### 4. Fixed Transaction Data Structure  
- Added missing `userId` field to all transaction creation calls
- Fixed transaction mapping from Appwrite to include userId

### 5. Implemented Card Balance Refresh System
- Added `refreshCardBalances()` function in AppContext
- Fetches fresh card balances from Appwrite database after transactions
- Updates local card state with current database balances
- Automatically triggered after successful transfers and deposits

### 6. Fixed Activity Event Interface
- Added `description` field to ActivityEvent interface
- Added description to all activity event creations

### 7. Card Service Method Binding
- Ensured all exported functions from cardService are properly bound
- Fixed method context issues with proper binding in exports

## How Card Balance Fetching Works

1. **Initial Load**: Cards are loaded from Appwrite database with current balances
2. **Transaction Updates**: After any successful transaction (transfer/deposit), balances are refreshed from database
3. **Real-time Updates**: Card service supports real-time balance updates via Appwrite subscriptions
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If Appwrite is unavailable, local state is maintained until connection restored

## Key Functions

- `refreshCardBalances()`: Refreshes all card balances from database
- `getActiveCards()`: Fetches active cards with current balances from Appwrite
- `updateCardBalance()`: Updates balance in both local state and database
- Card service methods properly bound for context preservation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Add a card**: Verify card is created with correct initial balance from database
2. **Make a transfer**: Verify source and recipient balances are updated from database
3. **Make a deposit**: Verify card balance reflects database state after deposit
4. **Multiple cards**: Test with multiple cards to ensure correct card balances are updated

## Expected Behavior

- Card balances always reflect the most current database state
- Local optimistic updates are replaced with database values after 1 second delay
- No hardcoded balance values - all balances come from Appwrite database
- Real-time balance updates when changes occur in database
